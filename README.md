# Voice Transformer v2.0 (Rust Edition with Web Interface)

A real-time voice processing tool written in Rust, designed for minimal latency with both terminal and web-based interfaces. This project was originally started in Python and has been completely rewritten in Rust for better performance and control.

## Features

- **Low-Latency Audio Processing**: Directly processes audio streams using `cpal`.
- **Feedback Prevention**: Implements a subtle frequency shift to prevent audio feedback loops in real-time.
- **Noise Reduction**: Includes a basic noise gate to filter out background noise below a certain threshold.
- **Interactive Real-Time Controls**: Adjust parameters like volume, noise gate threshold, frequency shift, and buffer size while the application is running.
- **üéµ Terminal Visualization**: Live FFT-based frequency spectrum analyzer with color-coded frequency bands in the terminal.
- **üåê Web Interface**: Modern browser-based visualization with real-time WebSocket streaming for enhanced visual experience.
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Choose between terminal-only mode or web interface with live data streaming.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **System Audio Libraries**: The `cpal` crate may require system libraries for audio I/O.
    - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev`
    - **Windows/macOS**: Dependencies are usually handled by the system.

## Installation and Building

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tasdelenn/voice-transformer.git
    cd voice-transformer
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    For a development build:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
    For an optimized release build (recommended for running):
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

The compiled executable will be in `./target/release/` or `./target/debug/`.

### Basic Setup

1.  **List available audio devices:**
    ```bash
    cargo run -- --list-devices
    ```
    This will show you a list of input device IDs you can use.

### Terminal Mode

2.  **Run the application in terminal mode:**
    To run with the default input device:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```
    To run with a specific input device:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release -- --device <DEVICE_ID>
    ```
    Replace `<DEVICE_ID>` with the ID of your input device from the list.

### Web Interface Mode

3.  **Run the application with web interface:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --release -- --web
    ```
    Or with a specific device:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release -- --web --device <DEVICE_ID>
    ```
    
    Once running:
    - Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3030`
    - You'll see a real-time frequency spectrum visualization
    - The web interface displays both input (microphone) and output (processed) audio spectrums
    - Data is streamed via WebSocket for smooth, low-latency updates
    - The visualization automatically scales and updates in real-time

3.  **Interactive Commands:**
    Once running, you can use the following keys to adjust settings in real-time:
    - `v`: Change volume (0.0 - 1.0).
    - `n`: Change noise gate threshold (0.0 - 0.1).
    - `a`: Change attack time for noise gate (0.0 - 0.1 seconds).
    - `r`: Change release time for noise gate (0.0 - 0.5 seconds).
    - `s`: Change smoothing factor (0.0 - 1.0).
    - `f`: Change frequency shift (in Hz).
    - `b`: Change the audio buffer size.
    - `w`: **üéµ Launch real-time frequency spectrum visualization** - Press any key to exit.
    - `d`: Reset all settings to their default values.
    - `i`: Display the current settings.
    - `q`: Quit the application.

## Frequency Spectrum Visualization

The frequency spectrum visualization feature (`w` command) provides:
- **Real-time FFT analysis** with 1024-point FFT size
- **Color-coded frequency bands**:
  - üî¥ **Red**: Bass frequencies (0-250 Hz)
  - üü° **Yellow**: Low-mid frequencies (250-500 Hz)
  - üü¢ **Green**: Mid frequencies (500-2000 Hz)
  - üîµ **Cyan**: High-mid frequencies (2-6 kHz)
  - üü£ **Magenta**: High frequencies (6+ kHz)
- **Numeric frequency and amplitude scales**
- **Real-time updates** showing live audio spectrum
- **Hanning window** for better frequency analysis

The visualization runs at ~10 FPS and shows both the processed audio output and frequency resolution information.
